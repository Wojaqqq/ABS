# ABS System

The topic of this issue is the construction of a model of the ABS system and its computer simulation using Matlab. During the simulation, we consider a car moving in a straight line while braking for different scenarios such as braking on dry and wet concrete, snow or ice. For each of the above scenarios, we study braking with and without ABS.
